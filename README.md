# Remote Work Productivity Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project is part of the MSc. Big Data Analytics program at St. Aloysius (Deemed to be University), AIMIT, Mangalore. It explores the factors influencing productivity and work-life balance in remote work settings using machine learning techniques.

## üìå Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly transitioned global workforces to remote work. This study uses survey-based data to predict employee preferences (remote vs. office work) and identify key drivers of productivity and satisfaction.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset (`ML_final.csv`) consists of responses to questions regarding:
- Workspace and technology setup
- Daily work habits
- Meeting preferences
- Social and psychological factors
- Work model preferences

The target variable:  
**"Do you prefer working from home over the office?"**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Models Used:**
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Logistic Regression

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Encoding  
3. Train-Test Split (80:20)  
4. Model Training  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
6. Feature Importance Analysis  

## üß† Key Findings

- **Top Productivity Factors:**  
  - Dedicated workspace  
  - Stable internet connection  
  - Use of time management tools  
  - Taking regular breaks  
  - Ability to maintain work-life balance  

- **Model Accuracy:**
  - MLP Classifier: 98%
  - Logistic Regression: 98%
  - Random Forest: 96%

## üìà Future Enhancements

- Expand the dataset to include broader demographics
- Include additional features like job role and household size
- Deploy a web tool for remote work readiness assessments
- Conduct longitudinal studies for trend analysis
